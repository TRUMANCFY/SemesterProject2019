Sport Chek is the largest Canadian retailer of sporting clothing and sports equipment, with stores throughout Canada (excluding Yukon). Its parent company, FGL Sports, operates stores under the following corporate and franchise banners:  Sport Chek,  National Sports, Sports Experts, Intersport, Atmosphere (formerly Coast Mountain Sports), Service Shop, Econosports,  Nevada Bob's Golf, and Hockey Experts
In 1999, a Sport Supercenter flagship store was opened on the top level of the Londonderry Mall, replacing an existing Walmart store. In 2014, the Londonderry Mall store relocated to Manning Town Centre, and was replaced by Simons in 2017. There was a second one in Place d'Orleans, but it was converted to Sport Chek/Nevada's Bob Golf in 2012.
In 2011, Canadian Tire bought FGL Sports (then known as Forzani) for $771 million, and has since embarked on a large scale brand restructuring. New SportChek stores with Samsung OLED screens, tablets and high tech were opened at West Edmonton Mall in 2014, Square One and Yorkdale in 2015, and a flagship SportChek/Atmosphere opened in Sherway Gardens in the GTA in July 2016.
